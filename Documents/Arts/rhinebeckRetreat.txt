The Rhinebeck Writers Retreat, a summer residency for developing new musicals, has announced its latest class: 19 writers and composers who are working on nine shows.

Each recipient will spend one week at the retreat in the Hudson Valley — the upstate New York locale of Richard Nelson’s cycles “The Apple Family Plays” and “The Gabriels: Election Year in the Life of One Family.”

Among this year’s class members are the composer Chris Miller and the lyricist Nathan Tysen, the writing partners behind the short-lived musical “Tuck Everlasting” on Broadway last year. In Rhinebeck, they will work on “Eric Hermannson’s Soul,” inspired by a Willa Cather short story of the same name about a fiddler who is torn between his religious convictions and love.

Other artists include the lyricist, librettist and playwright Stacey Luftig, who won the $100,000 Kleban Prize in 2016 and is writing “Saving Amelia” with the composer Phillip Palmer. And Mark Sonnenblick will spend his week working on the book, music and lyrics for his musical, “Devotion,” about the hapless residents of Braxton, Ohio, whose working-class woes echo those of Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play “Sweat,” currently on Broadway.

The nine winning musical projects were selected from a pool of 113 applications that were reviewed by industry insiders like Jason Eagan of Ars Nova and Kent Nicholson of Playwrights Horizons.
