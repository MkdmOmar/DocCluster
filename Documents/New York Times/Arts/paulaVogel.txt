Paula Vogel, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright whose Broadway drama “Indecent” is a best-play Tony Award nominee, will conduct a free playwriting workshop at the Vineyard Theater on May 22.

Ms. Vogel has been hosting these workshops, which she calls boot camps, for students since 1984, and has also held sessions with veterans and prison inmates and in countries around the world. This one will be open to the first 30 people who RSVP to indecentbootcamp@gmail.com starting at noon on Tuesday. According to Ms. Vogel, this will be her first workshop aimed at the general public in 13 years. She will lead a discussion and writing exercises, with the aim of each participant writing a short play by the end of the day.

During her years as head of playwriting programs at Brown and Yale, Ms. Vogel has taught the Pulitzer winners Lynn Nottage and Nilo Cruz, as well as the Pulitzer finalists Sarah Ruhl and Sarah DeLappe. “I came to realize that I can be far more useful to the field of playwriting, and to people who dream of writing, if I have more time to talk and think about the actual work,” Ms. Vogel said in an interview after one of her boot camps in 2012.
