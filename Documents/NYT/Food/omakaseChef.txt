The chef David Bouhadana has left Sushi on Jones to open a similar Tokyo-style omakase sushi counter in the Gansevoort Market. Like his previous stand, this one will offer 12 pieces for $50 to eat in 30 minutes. It’s a version of what Sukiyabashi Jiro, the famous chef in “Jiro Dreams of Sushi,” and others do for a few more bites and a lot more money. When he opens on May 15, Mr. Bouhadana will have four seats at his counter in the rear of the market, along with an area for takeout. He will also welcome guest chefs in his open kitchen: Sushi by Bou, Gansevoort Market, 353 West 14th Street, text reservation requests to 917-870-1587
