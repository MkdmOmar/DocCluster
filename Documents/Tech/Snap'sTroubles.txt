Snap caught people’s imaginations when the company, which is the parent of the messaging app Snapchat, went public in March. After all, here was this hip young social media service, with its hip young founders and a hip young audience, taking its new ways of communicating to the staid old New York Stock Exchange.

This week, though, Snap caught people’s imaginations for a different reason — it went from darling to dud after a tepid earnings report. And the implications of that quick change are spreading to other tech start-ups and investors.

Snap’s performance is a reminder to many venture capitalists and entrepreneurs of the hazards of taking a company public, writes Katie Benner, a technology reporter for The New York Times. In Silicon Valley, some are now reassessing the prospects for their companies’ going public and how prepared they are for such an event, especially if faced with stifling scrutiny from Wall Street investors.

Snap’s earnings showed that “your house has to be in order before you go public,” Rebecca Lynn, a venture capitalist at Canvas Ventures, told our reporter. “Your job is to predict what you’ll hit and then do it.”
